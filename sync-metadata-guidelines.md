This document discusses and defines terms and processes related to creating and managing metadata in music files, specifically MP3 and AIF.
I won't get into WAV files at the start, although I may add some of this content over time.

Song metadata generally conforms to the standard entitled ID3V2.3. This implements metadata as frames at the start of an MP3 or AIF file.
The main difference is that an MP3 is compressed and so not always the level of quality you want as there can be artifacts introduced by the compression.
