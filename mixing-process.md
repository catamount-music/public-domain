# Mixing Strategy

> [!TIP]
> The best mix comes from the best tracks. The closer the tracks are to being mixable, the better the final product will be.

## Overview

The framework of the process is to work from region to track to track groups, bouncing reference tracks at key points in the process. The quality of how something
sounds is relative and you need the references from each major step in the process.

This process is working well for our kinds of recordings, typically production quality instrumental, pop, and niche songs with organic instrumentation.
We use a lot of acoustic instruments, including piano, guitar, and various percussion instruments.

## Mixing Checklist

### 1. Create MIX1

- [ ] BOUNCE the initial track, `MIX1`

### 2. Process Individual Tracks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step is highly iterative, in that you'll need to process regions within tracks, and then tracks, and then groups of tracks in step 3.

- [ ] Comp the region stacks
- [ ] Solo the track; list issues; fix anything that’s not in the section below
- [ ] Consider the following effects in this order:
1. De-essing
2. Noise gate
3. EQ
4. Limiter
5. Compressor

### 3. Organizing the Workspace

- [ ] Fix track groups (drums, multiple tracks of guitar or piano, etc.)
    * Group the tracks
    * Set relative levels
    * Use the same basic process in 2. above.
- [ ] Apply LogicPro color scheme (`LogicProColorScheme.png`)

### 4. Mixing Track Groups and Stacks

Set mix levels for track groups - basic initial mix

- [ ] Review for any places with dynamics problems - for automation below
- [ ] Review for any places with frequency competition (esp. in bass)
- [ ] Review for any places where instruments are not separable and can’t be distinctly heard

### 5. Add Reverbs

- [ ] Plate reverb bus for really short reverb
- [ ] Room reverb bus for main reverb
- [ ] Custom reverb busses should the arrangement need it (separate one for vocals, or different parts of the drums, etc.)

### 6. Add Automation

- [ ] Volume
- [ ] Stereo panning
- [ ] Adjusting width of mix for different sections
- [ ] Side-chain compression

### 7. Bounce the Rough Mix (MIX2)

- [ ] Bounce `MIX2`
- [ ] Fix any issues you notice

### 8. Bounce the Edited Rough Mix (MIX3)

- [ ] Bounce `MIX3`

### 9. Quality Checks

Run all of these to identify issues; there may be issues that are interrelated and solving one may 
exacerbate another. Spot check after fixing issues, to mitigate the risk of making anything worse 
through attempted corrections.

- [ ] Listen to final track for any distractions (pops, clicks, hisses, etc.) that can’t be taken out in mastering
- [ ] Identify any dynamic problems (hot spots, low spots, transients)
- [ ] Turn the volume up by 6 or 10 db to see if the mix holds up, or if there are rough spots in the frequencies
- [ ] Turn the volume down by 6 or 10 db. Can you distinctly hear the main melodic voice with enough supporting instruments to understand the composition?
- [ ] Listen on several platforms
    1. Speakers with no bass or treble
    2. iPhone
    3. iPad
    4. HiFi stereo system
- [ ] Check overall stereo levels
    1. Measure the output signals in db and lufs
    2. check headroom (peak over RMS in bass, mid, and treble)
- [ ] Take reverb down at the end so if it rings out the ending
- [ ] Make any changes related to quality findings

### 10. BOUNCE the QA’d version (MIX4, should be FINAL MIX, or pre-master)

- [ ] Bounce `MIX4`

## Additional Considerations:

* Do not use any effects you don’t need. Keep it simple.
* If you can’t fix the track with four or five adjustments, review the the performance, recording, or arrangement to fix it.
* A reference song should be identified as a comparison to see if the mix hits the target.

## More tips to incorporate

Use the same color coding for tracks, i.e., green for drums, red for bass, etc.
Use the same arrangement for tracks, i.e., drums at top groups and master at bottom
“Print the rough cut” - bounce the track after the rough initial mix so you have a reference
Don’t mix longer than four hours
Have a vision for what the song should sound like
Some things can’t be fixed by mixing or EQ, especially when you have two or more competing instruments. Sometimes it can only be addressed by changing the arrangement or other pre-mixing techniques

Check phase of samples, potentially reverse polarity of signal to avoid phase cancelation

Five click rule. If you have to do more than five clicks to fix something, there must be a better way to do it, either through a workflow optimization, arrangement or recording technique, etc.

Don’t need to master to any specific loudness.

Soloing channel slows you down. When you fix something solo’d, it doesn’t necessarily work with the rest of the tracks

There are some cases where you do need better gear, better monitoring environment, etc. Understand the limitations of your equipment

There’s no formula or exact step by step

Create space: relationship between melody and bass is the essence of the song - above reverb
Can have several reverbs
 
* short reverb like office or room if the mic was really close to the mouth
* Plate reverb (this is the one you want to hear, but doesn’t connote size of room)
* Wash is ambiance for the whole track that illustrates size of room

You may have to deliver multiple versions of the same song

1. Whole song
2. Drums and bass only
3. Instrumental only (no vocals)
4. And so on

May need to provide unmastered stems
If you fix things in the master, they won’t apply to the versions above, so check those groups during the mixing process.
Do this by using groups, track stacking, and bus sends to combine common instruments into stems (all strings, all percussion, etc.).
