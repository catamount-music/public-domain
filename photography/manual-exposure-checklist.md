# Manual Exposure Checklist

> [!NOTE]
> This is a list of steps to take to ensure that you have a reasonable chance of getting the shot.
> I often forget steps, including taking the lens cap off, because I use a manual camera with film.

## Check Exposure Triangle

- What's the ISO?
- What's the shutter speed?
- What's the aperture?

- Are those things set properly on the camera?

## Check Lens

- Is lens cap off?
- Is circular polarizer (or ND gradient, or whatevs) aligned properly
- Are there specs of dust or other objects on the lens?

## Check Stability

- Do you need a tripod
- - if the expousre is under 30 seconds, the answer is yes, unless you are going for a very specific kind of motion look
- Do you have a cable release or remote trigger ready?

## Record Keeping

- Did you record the following:
- - Shutter speed
  - ISO
  - Aperture
  - Filters
  - Any important metering information
  - Developing instructions
